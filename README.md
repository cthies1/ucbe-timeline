DESIGN PROBLEM: To design a website for people interested in learning about UC Berkely Extension’s history and to make this website easy to use, interesting, and visually compelling. 

DESIGN PROCESS: I started by reviewing the materials given to me by the university including historical information and images as well as an approved color palette, typography, and basic formatting layout. Based on these details, I designed a website that cohesively combined all of these elements.

DESIGN SOLUTION: The website contains 3 main sections: the homepage detailing the beginnings of UC Berkeley Extension, seven decade pages spanning 1891-2020, and one final page reviewing the current year 2021. Each page contains a written description as well as images that detail the university’s history.
